# Website-performance-analysis-
Analyzed various metrics related to a websiteâ€™s functionality, user engagement, and overall success using python pandas and matplotlib

The dataset we are working on contains the following columns:
- Session primary channel group: The marketing channel (e.g., Direct, Organic Social)
- Date + hour (YYYYMMDDHH): The specific date and hour of the session
- Users: Number of users in a given period
- Sessions: Number of sessions in that period
- Engaged sessions: Number of sessions with significant user engagement
- Average engagement time per session: The average time a user is engaged per session
- Engaged sessions per user: Ratio of engaged sessions to total sessions per user
- Events per session: Average number of events (actions taken) per session
- Engagement rate: The proportion of sessions that were engaged
- Event count: Total number of events during the period

I included the csv file incase you want to recreate the analysis and perform your own additional analysis on it. For a comprehensive explanation of each line of code please visit the medium article for this project: https://medium.com/@moyeedjo/website-performance-analysis-using-python-e61b3ddc5696
